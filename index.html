              Why is Rihanna one of the most prominent artist's of the
              21st-century?
            </h3>
            <p>
              It’s not uncommon for artists in the music industry to be
              multi-talented, but it's pretty rare for artists to be very
              successful in business, the fashion industry and their music
              career. Rihanna who is a global pop and fashion icon, continues to
              push boundaries with billboard records as a singer, songwriter,
              businesswoman, performer, and actress.
            </p>
            <p>
              The bad-gyal Riri is well-known for her powerful vocal range and
              diverse musical style but has become a true fashion icon due to
              her profound fashion style and creativity at the MET Gala. She is
              also the second best-selling female music artist of all time and
              the highest certified female artist of all time on the RIAA’s
              digital ranking. She didn’t just stop there, she created and
              launched two flourishing businesses. The first one being “Fenty
              Beauty” and the second being “Savage X Fenty”. These companies are
              well known for breaking beauty standards and their extensive range
              of inclusivity.
            </p>
            <p>
              From selling over 250 million records worldwide, to being the most
              watched performer at the super bowl half-time, then being the
              wealthiest female musician, and lastly being a humanitarian. You
              can say for certain that Riri has put in “work work work”.

                  Loud. It showcases reggae, Caribbean rhythms with some hint of

                  accent and vocal agility when expressing regret to ending
                  someone's life.

                  progresses to a powerhouse vocal performance that emphasizes
                  the pain from being in a destructive, yet addictive
                  relationship.
