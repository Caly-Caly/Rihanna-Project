              Why is Rihanna one of the most prominent artist's of the
              21st-century?
            </h3>
            <p>
              It’s not uncommon for artists in the music industry to be
              multi-talented, but it's pretty rare for artists to be very
              successful in business, the fashion industry and their music
              career. Rihanna is a global pop and fashion icon, who continues to
              push boundaries and records as a singer, songwriter,
              businesswoman, performer, and actress.
            </p>

              The bad-gal Riri is well-known for her powerful vocal range and
              diverse music style but has become a true fashion icon due to her
              profound fashion style and creativity at the MET Gala. She is also
              the second best-selling female music artist of all time and the
              highest certified female artist of all time on the RIAA’s digital
              ranking. She didn’t just stop there, she created and launched two
              flourishing businesses. The first one being “Fenty Beauty” and the
              second being “Savage X Fenty”. These companies are well known for
              breaking beauty standards and their extensive range of
              inclusivity.
            </p>
            <p>
              From selling over 250 million records worldwide, to being the most
              watched performer at the super bowl half-time, then being the
              wealthiest female musician, and lastly being a humanitarian. You
              can say for certain that Riri has put in “work work work”.
